Passage: “The Mystery of the Missing Monarchs”
1
Every fall, millions of monarch butterflies travel thousands of miles from the northern United States and Canada to warmer areas in Mexico. Scientists call this long journey a migration. For many years, researchers have studied the monarchs to understand how such small creatures can travel so far. But recently, scientists noticed something unusual: fewer monarchs were arriving in Mexico each year.

2
To solve this mystery, scientists began looking for clues. One clue came from studying the monarchs’ food source. Monarch caterpillars eat only one plant—milkweed. In many places, milkweed has become harder to find because fields are being cleared for new buildings or farms. Without enough milkweed, fewer caterpillars survive long enough to become butterflies.

3
Another clue came from weather patterns. Monarchs depend on warm temperatures and gentle winds to guide them during migration. But sudden storms, strong winds, and unexpected cold fronts can blow the butterflies off course. Some monarchs become too weak to continue their journey.

4
Scientists also discovered that monarchs face dangers from predators. Birds and insects sometimes eat the butterflies during their migration. While this has always been part of nature, the loss of habitat and changing weather make it harder for monarchs to recover from these losses.

5
To help the monarchs, communities across North America have started planting milkweed gardens. Schools, parks, and even homeowners are creating safe spaces for monarchs to rest and feed. Scientists hope that these efforts will help the monarch population grow again. The mystery of the missing monarchs is not fully solved, but people everywhere are working together to protect these remarkable travelers.

📘 Fiction Passage (Single Selection)
The Mystery of the Missing Marble
Lila kept her favorite blue marble in a tiny wooden box on her desk. It wasn’t just any marble — it had a swirl inside that looked like a tiny storm cloud. Her grandfather had given it to her before he moved far away, and she treasured it more than anything else in her room.

One afternoon, Lila opened the box to admire the marble, but the box was empty. She blinked, checked again, and then checked a third time. The marble was gone.

Lila’s little brother, Mateo, was sitting on the floor building a tower of blocks. “Mateo, did you take my marble?”, she asked.

Mateo shook his head. “No. I’m busy building the tallest tower ever.”

Lila believed him — Mateo wasn’t great at hiding things, and he usually told the truth. She decided to search the rest of her room. She looked under her bed, behind her books, and even inside her shoes. Nothing.

Just when she was about to give up, she noticed a faint trail of glitter on her desk. It wasn’t hers. Lila followed the glitter across the hallway and into the living room. The trail led straight to a small, fluffy creature curled up on the couch — her cat, Nimbus.

Nimbus lifted her head and blinked slowly, as if she had been expecting Lila. Right beside her paws was the blue marble, shining under the lamp.

“Nimbus!” Lila said, scooping up the marble. “You’re the thief!”

Nimbus purred loudly and rubbed her head against Lila’s hand. Lila couldn’t stay mad. She carried the marble back to her room and placed it safely in the wooden box — this time closing the lid tightly.

As she walked away, she heard a soft thump from the living room. Nimbus had jumped off the couch. Lila narrowed her eyes. She had a feeling this mystery might not be over.
