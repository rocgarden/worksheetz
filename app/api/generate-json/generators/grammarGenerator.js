You are an elementary teacher assistant.

### Example Worksheet (for style and structure):
"""${exampleText}"""

---

### Task
Generate **${count} new worksheets** for **Grade ${gradeLevel}** students.  
Topic: **${topic}**  
Concept: **${concept}**

### Requirements for EACH worksheet:
1. **Concept Introduction** 
- Concept
- Brief explanation of the concept (2–3 sentences, age-appropriate). 
- Include 1 clear example.
2. **Guided Practice** 
- "instructions": short instructions for a task (e.g. "Choose the noun or nouns in each sentence below. Each sentence may have more than 1 choice."). 
- "guided_practice": An array of 7-8 practice items. 
- Each item should include: 
* "sentence": the practice sentence. 
* "choices" as an array of 3–4 possible words of objects with "id" and "text" fields (e.g., {"id": "a", "text": "..."})
* "answer": all the possible correct option words from the choices array.
- Include 1 open-ended question with prompt type about the concept (e.g. "Write your own sentence with at least 2 nouns.")
3. **Independent Practice 1** 
- "instructions": short instructions (e.g. "Read the paragraph and choose the best answer to each question. Some questions may have more than 1 answer."). 
- Write a **short story (150–200 words)** that is age-appropriate and should include examples of the concept. 
- **Number (should be in parentheses) each sentence** in the story for easy reference.
4. **Concept Questions** 
- Always Create **6-7 multiple-choice questions** about the concept (e.g. "Which word in sentence 2 is a proper noun?"). 
- Each question must follow this JSON format:

{
  "question": "Which word in sentence 2 is a proper noun?",
  "choices": [
    { "id": "a", "text": "run" },
    { "id": "b", "text": "out" },
    { "id": "c", "text": "school" },
    { "id": "d", "text": "sunny" }
  ],  
  "answer": ["c"]
}
3. **Independent Practice 2** 
- "instructions": short instructions (e.g. "Read the paragraph and choose the best answer to each question. Some questions may have more than 1 answer."). 
- Write a **short story (150–200 words)** that is age-appropriate and should include examples of the concept. 
- **Number (should be in parentheses) each sentence** in the story for easy reference.
4. **Concept Questions** 
- Always Create **6-7 multiple-choice questions** about the concept (e.g. "Which word in sentence 2 is a proper noun?"). 
- Each question must follow this JSON format:

{
  "question": "Which word in sentence 2 is a proper noun?",
  "choices": [
    { "id": "a", "text": "run" },
    { "id": "b", "text": "out" },
    { "id": "c", "text": "school" },
    { "id": "d", "text": "sunny" }
  ],
  "answer": ["c"]
}

- Rules for independent practice choices:
  * There must be 12-14 multiple choice questions and an extra open-ended question.
  * There must always be **exactly 4 multiple answer choices**.  
  * Choices must always be objects with "id" and "text" fields (e.g., {"id": "a", "text": "..."})  
  * The "answer" array must include the full labeled choice(s), e.g. :["B) run"].  
  * Randomize the correct answer position (not always A).  
- Ensure either 1 correct answer OR (if grammar/meaning allows multiple) clearly mark all correct ones.  
- One question must be an **exception question** (e.g. "Which word is NOT a noun?").  
- Include 1 open-ended question (type: "open-ended") about the concept.


5. Answer key

### Notes 
- Maintain **the same structure and tone as the example worksheet**. 
- Do not repeat content from the example. 
- If the worksheet includes any open-ended questions (e.g., "Write your own sentence..."), include them in the JSON as objects with "type": "open-ended" and a "prompt" string. Do not leave these questions only in the text.

Return **valid JSON** in the following structure:
